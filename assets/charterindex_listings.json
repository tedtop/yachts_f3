He speaks Greek and English. Nikolas grew up in the coastal suburbs of Athens and has spent most of his life in or near, the sea. His involvement with sailing began at a very young age and at the age of nine, he started competing in the optimist sailing class. He then moved on to different classes and has competed in 420 and RS:X sailboats. He has participated in many sailing regattas both at the national and international level and has been a member of the Hellenic National Sailing Team both in 2008 and 2010. He has been awarded numerous medals including the Hellenic National Sailing Championship 420 class Silver Medal and the Hellenic National Sailing Championship RS:X class bronze and Silver medals. His passion for the sea led him to offshore yacht racing, where he has been competing the last years. His career at sea started as crew on offshore deliveries both in Greece and abroad and progressed to a permanent crew position on several very impressive super-yachts, but his love for sailing led him to pursue a career as a professional sailboat skipper. As a skipper, he has completed several national and international yacht deliveries and holiday charters. Nikolas holds an RYA/MCA Yacht-master Ocean Certificate of Competence, commercially endorsed for both sail and power-driven vessels and a valid Greek Seaman’s Book with all relevant STCW certificates up to date. He has completed numerous offshore deliveries of new-built and used sail and motor yachts, both as skipper and crew and can ensure the successful completion of any new challenge presented to him. His sociable and pleasant character gives him the ability to make people feel at ease near him, and his knowledge and ability provide a sense of security to his charter guests. Always trying to improve himself and the level of his services, he will do everything he can to provide a satisfying experience personalized for each of his guests. His interests other than sailing include surfing, exercising and traveling.</p> </div></div></div></div></div></div> </div>",
